freegeoip.net web server
========================

This is the current web server of freegeoip.net, a public HTTP API for
searching [Geolocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation) of IP
addresses.

It is the result of a research project that started in 2009 using
[Google App Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolocation)'s Python API.
A year later it moved to its own server infrastructure, built on the
[cyclone](http://cyclone.io) web framework and backed by pypy.

It's been rewritten in Go using [go-web](https://github.com/fiorix/go-web).

Database
--------

The database is composed of multiple files, from multiple sources. It's a
combination of IP networks, country codes, city names, etc.

There's a helper script under the _db_ directory that tries to download all
files, process and combine them to build the database. It might eventually
fail.

Make sure the db exists before starting the server. In the _db_ directory,
execute *updatedb* - it's a Python script. Should look like this:

	$ ./updatedb

This service includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from
maxmind.com.

Usage
-----

Run the dev server with *go run freegeoip.go* and point your browser to it.
Use curl to query the API, like this:

	$ curl http://localhost:8080/xml/ip_or_hostname

It supports CSV, JSON and XML. If *ip_or_hostname* is omitted, the IP of the
client making the request is used.

If the server is listening on unix sockets, use *nc* to test:

	echo -ne 'GET /json/ HTTP/1.0\r\nX-Real-IP: pwnz\r\n\r\n' | nc -U /tmp/freegeoip

To receive asn information add ?asn=true to the query url, example:

	$ curl http://localhost:8080/json/ip_or_hostname?asn=true

Command line
------------

To query the API from the command line, add this to *~/.bash_profile*:

	function geoip_curl_xml { curl -D - http://freegeoip.net/xml/$1; }
	alias geoip=geoip_curl_xml
